# PBH Contracts

[Priority blockspace for humans (PBH)](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-chain?tab=readme-ov-file#world-chain-builder) enables verified World ID users to execute transactions with top of block priority, enabling a more frictionless user experience onchain. This mechanism is designed to ensure that ordinary users aren’t unfairly disadvantaged by automated systems and greatly mitigates the negative impact of MEV.

[ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) is designed to enable [account abstraction](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/) via an “entry point” contract and “user operations”. A `UserOperation` is a payload that is defined by a user, specifying actions that a “bundler” can execute on their behalf. The `EntryPoint` contract conducts all of the necessary validation logic, executes the user operation onchain and manages any post execution logic (ex. paymaster logic). Users send their `UserOperation` to “bundlers”, which are services that maintain a mempool of many `UserOperation`s, bundling them together to submit them to the blockchain for inclusion.

4337 PBH features `PBHSignatureAggregator`, `PBHEntryPoint`, and `PBH4337Module` contracts.

*PBHEntryPoint*

The `PBHEntryPoint` acts as a proxy in front of the singleton 4337 EntryPoint contract onchain. The builder is able to identify a PBH transaction by the target. For a transaction to be considered PBH, the `to` address of the transaction must be set to the `PBHEntryPoint`. 

The `PBHEntryPoint` contract exposes two functions:

`handleAggregatedOps()` 
- Allows a Bundler to submit a Priority Bundle transaction where the [aggregated signature](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/b3bae63bd9bc0ed394dfca8668008213127adb62/contracts/interfaces/IEntryPoint.sol#L144) contains a vector encoding of WorldID proof's, and associated proof data to be verified onchain, or by the block builder ordering the block. 

`pbhMulticall()` 
- The PBH Multicall allows WorldID users to execute a multicall with top of block inclusion by attaching a valid WorldID proof in the calldata. The proof is verified either by block builder before transaction inclusion, or onchain. This mechanism enables non-4337 transactions to have top of block inclusion. 

*PBHSignatureAggregator*
- The `PBHSignatureAggregator` serves as a utility contract to the bundler to aggregate UserOperation proofs onto the aggregate signature of `handleAggregatedOps`. It also serves as a cryptographic link between the `PBHEntryPoint`, and the Priority UserOperation thereby guaranteeing a bundler cannot change the target address of a PBH Bundle to the EntryPoint yielding non-priority transaction ordering. 

*PBH4337Module*
- The `PBH4337Module` is an extension of the [Safe 4337 module](https://github.com/worldcoin/safe-modules/blob/9abf69ea1df673c1010aeb9bbbc6aa14124ba425/modules/4337/contracts/Safe4337Module.sol) that returns a custom validation path based on the [nonce key](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-chain/blob/6f0b018fdd937b0d023569755cb90f2a1f1abd65/contracts/src/PBH4337Module.sol#L16). The validation path returned from `_validateSignatures` allows the bundler to seamlessly group PBH UserOperations that specify the `PBHSignatureAggregator`.

Signature Scheme:
```
Bytes [0 : 12] Timestamp Validation Data
Bytes [12 : 65 * signatureThreshold + 12] ECDSA Signatures
Bytes [65 * signatureThreshold + 12 : 65 * signatureThreshold + 364] ABI Encoded Proof Data
```
