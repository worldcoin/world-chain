//! Build script: compile the World Chain SP1 guest programs and emit
//! `SP1_ELF_<crate>` environment variables for `sp1_sdk::include_elf!()`.
//!
//! This is the OP Succinct upstream pattern (see `utils/build/` in
//! `succinctlabs/op-succinct`): the ELF bytes live entirely as compile-time
//! build artifacts, embedded into the host binary at link time via
//! `include_elf!()`. There are no committed ELF blobs and no runtime
//! `fs::read` of an ELF file.
//!
//! Behaviour:
//! - By default uses `docker: true` with the pinned SP1 toolchain tag
//!   (matches the `=6.1.0` version of `sp1-sdk` / `sp1-zkvm` the workspace
//!   pins to) for bit-for-bit reproducible ELFs. Set
//!   `SP1_BUILD_DOCKER=false` to use a locally-installed `cargo-prove` /
//!   `sp1up` toolchain instead — useful inside container builds where the
//!   Docker daemon isn't reachable.
//! - Honours `SP1_SKIP_PROGRAM_BUILD=true` for fast iteration: when set, the
//!   build is skipped but the `SP1_ELF_*` env vars are still emitted so
//!   `include_elf!()` resolves against a previously-built ELF in
//!   `target/elf-compilation/...`. Useful for `cargo check`/`clippy` once
//!   a single full build has populated the target directory.
//! - Under `cargo clippy`, the `#[cfg(clippy)]` guards in `src/lib.rs`
//!   prevent `include_elf!()` from expanding, so no ELF files need to exist.
