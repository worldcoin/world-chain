# contracts

This repo contains contracts and scripts for Base.
Note that Base primarily utilizes Optimism's bedrock contracts located in Optimism's repo [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock).
For contract deployment artifacts, see [base-org/contract-deployments](https://github.com/base-org/contract-deployments).

### Fixing semver-lock CI failures

If the `semver-lock` CI check fails, regenerate locally and commit:

```bash
just semver-lock
```

If CI still rejects it (Foundry version mismatch), update your local Foundry first:

```bash
foundryup
just semver-lock
```

### setup and testing

- If you don't have foundry installed, run `just install-foundry`.
- `just deps`
- Test contracts: `just test`
